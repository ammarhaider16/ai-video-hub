# AI Video Hub

Welcome to **AI Video Hub**, an Expo-based React Native application designed to allow users to share and explore AI-generated videos. This project showcases the integration of various front-end and back-end technologies, demonstrating how to build a robust mobile app with capabilities for media sharing and social interaction.

## Features

- **Video Sharing**: Users can upload videos generated by AI, complete with titles, thumbnails, and the prompts used for generation.
- **Responsive Design**: A user-friendly interface that works seamlessly across different mobile devices.
- **AI Content Integration**: Integration with AI tools to fetch and display video content.
- **Scalable Backend**: Initially powered by Appwrite for user management and data storage, with future plans to migrate to a more scalable solution using Express.js, MongoDB, and AWS.

## Technologies Used

### Frontend

- **Expo**: Utilized for building the app with the React Native framework.
  - `expo-av`: For handling audio and video functionalities.
  - `expo-constants`: For accessing system constants.
  - `expo-document-picker`: To enable document selection and management.
  - `expo-linking`: To handle deep linking within the app.
  - `expo-router`: Simplifies navigation and routing.
  - `expo-status-bar`: For managing the status bar across different screens.
  
- **React Native**: The core library for building the mobile app.
  - `react-native-animatable`: For adding animations to the app components.
  - `react-native-safe-area-context`: To ensure content is rendered within safe areas.
  - `react-native-screens`: For optimizing navigation and screen management.
  - `react-native-url-polyfill`: To provide URL parsing capabilities in React Native.
  
- **Nativewind**: A utility-first styling framework for React Native, inspired by Tailwind CSS.

### Backend

- **Appwrite**: A complete backend-as-a-service that provides:
  - User authentication and management.
  - Data storage and retrieval.
  - Real-time database capabilities.
  
- **Future Migration Plan**: The app’s backend will be migrated to a more scalable solution as follows:
  - **Express.js**: A robust Node.js framework to handle server-side logic and API management.
  - **MongoDB**: For flexible and scalable database management.
  - **AWS**: For efficient and scalable media storage solutions.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed on your system:

- **Node.js**: [Download and install Node.js](https://nodejs.org/).
- **Expo CLI**: Install the Expo CLI globally using `npm install -g expo-cli`.
- **Appwrite Server**: Set up Appwrite for backend services. Follow the [Appwrite setup guide](https://appwrite.io/docs).

### Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ammarhaider16/ai-video-hub.git
   cd ai-video-hub
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Start the Expo Development Server**:
   ```bash
   expo start
   ```

### Configuration

- **Appwrite Configuration**: Ensure your Appwrite server is running and configured correctly. Update the app configuration to point to your Appwrite endpoint.

- **Environment Variables**: Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add necessary environment variables (e.g., API keys, Appwrite project details).

## Usage

- **Upload Videos**: Use the app interface to upload AI-generated videos along with their titles, thumbnails, and prompts.
- **Explore Content**: Browse through videos shared by other users, view details, and interact with the community.

## Future Plans

- **Backend Migration**: Transitioning to a more scalable backend solution with Express.js, MongoDB, and AWS.
- **Enhanced Features**: Adding more social features like comments, likes, and sharing options.
- **Performance Improvements**: Continuous optimization for better performance and user experience.
